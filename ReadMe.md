This is my first website called Railway Management System

Using PostgreSQL, Express, and NodeJS

This project has been updated and now is version 3.0 or third form (apps folder)

The First Form means that the html include in javascript file called index.js

The Second Form means that the html is separate with javascript file but the index.js is not well build (not recommended code)

The Third Form or Apps Folder is like second form, but now the backend divided into some folder like route, controller, model, middleware, and utils using export express.

Overview:
This website made for admin to manage the database.
Admin can input data, update or change data, and delete data.

Without Login you only can see the data

There are 5 tables :

1. Kereta to store train data
2. Stasiun to store train Station data
3. Rute to store train route data
4. Tarif to store price of route
5. Admin to store username and password
but the table of admin is private.

For Login

username : rames

password : rames123




*Note Now the javascript file and html file are separated
