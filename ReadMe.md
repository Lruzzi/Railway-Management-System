This is my first website called Railway Management System
Using PostgreSQL, Express, and NodeJS
This will be updated since its all in file javascript and i want to divide the html and javascript file in the future and i want to add css file also
I made it for final project on Lab Data based System at Computer Engineering University of Indonesia 2022

Overview:
This website made for admin to manage the database.
Admin can input data, update or change data, and delete data.

Without Login you only can see the data

There are 5 tables :

1. Kereta to store train data
2. Stasiun to store train Station data
3. Rute to store train route data
4. Tarif to store price of route
5. Admin to store username and password
but the table of admin is private.

For Login

username : rames

password : rames123




*Note Now the javascript file and html file are separated
